# Chewbotcca-IRC

I made this bot for my IRC Channel. It's ok i guess.

## How to install and run

Installing:
1) Download using [Download Zip](https://github.com/Chewsterchew/ChewbotccaIRC/archive/master.zip) or idk just get the file from the website to your computer or wherever you're hosting.
2) Install ruby. don't ask me how just google it
3) Using Gem, install Rest-Client
4) If you want to use `!join` and `!part`, edit the respective files and change "yourhost" to your host mask.
5) Modify c.server to the server hostname. (e.g. irc.chew.pro)
6) Modify c.channels to automatically join those channels on startup.
7) If you want, change c.nick to whatever you want.

IF YOU'RE CONFUSED (which i already am), just send an issue.

Orr... join Chewbotcca IRC Channel! irc.chew.pro channel #Chewbotcca
