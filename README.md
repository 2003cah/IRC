## Official Public Chewbotccas

I run some of my chewbotccas on the following servers using the following nicknames

Server IP        | Nickname   | Help Channel
---------------- | ---------- | ------------
irc.chew.pro     | Chewbotcca | #Chewbotcca
irc.freenode.com | Chewbotcca | #Chewbotcca
irc.esper.net    | Chewbotcca | #Chew
irc.spi.gt       | Chewbotcca | #Chewbotcca

## Unofficial User-Maintained Chewbotccas

I don't promise 100% uptime with these, so use the owner's nickname to ask them questions.
