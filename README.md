# Chewbotcca IRC Bot

I made this bot for my IRC Network. It's ok, I guess.

## How to install and run

## Downloading

1) Download using `git clone https://github.com/Chewsterchew/ChewbotccaIRC`

2) Install ruby. don't ask me how just google it

3) Modify the config to your liking.

### Install extremely lazily

If you simply run `ruby bot.rb`, a GUI will help you install all the gems needed.

### Install via `gem install`

1) If on Mac or Linux, run `./scripts/installgems.sh` then `ruby bot.rb` otherwise:

```bash
gem install cinch nokogiri rest-client
ruby bot.rb
```

### Install using bundler

1) Download bundler gem with `gem install bundler`

2) `bundle install`

3) `bundle exec ruby bot.rb`

IF YOU'RE CONFUSED (which i already am), just send an issue.
